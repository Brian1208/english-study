    'Now Toad' said Heron, 'we must finish here.It's been a very full session and I am sure it has given you a lot to think about. So let me give you some homework for our next meeting.'
    'Oh no,'said Toad, looking quite anxiout, 'not homework!I always hated doing prep.I don't think I shall be able to do any this week.
    'In fact I've just remembered I have a lot of work to do.I will probably have to go up to town.And lots of other things.' he added lamely.There was a long silence.
    'Just as a matter of interest,'said Heron,'How would you analyse what you have just said to me?'
    'Well' said Toad, 'I simply told you why I am unable to do any homework.'
    He looked uneasy and found it difficult to meet Heron's eye.
    'Yes, but how do you think it sounded to me?'
    Toad shifted in his chair.'I don't know really.I merely gave you the reasons why I can't do it'
    'Perhaps you thought they sounded like excuses?'
    'What do you think?'asked Heron.
    'I can understan you think that,'answered Toad,'but the word "homework" gives me very bad feelings.
    'I can remember exactly how I felt at school in the eveving trying to learn Latin verbs or memories potery.And the fear of punishment the next morning if you got it wrong.'
    'So what state are you in if I suggested homework to you just now?'asked Heron.
    'Child,'replied Toad instantly.'All those old fears and anxieties came sweeping over me.Is there some thing wrong with me, Heron, that I should behave like that?'
